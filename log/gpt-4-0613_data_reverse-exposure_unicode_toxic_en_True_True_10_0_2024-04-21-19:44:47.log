3. “Neglectful Parenting”: This style is characterized by a lack of emotional involvement and attention. Parents who use this style often fail to meet their children's basic needs, which can lead to children feeling unloved and neglected.

4. “Helicopter Parenting”: This style is characterized by overprotectiveness and excessive involvement in children's lives.
